## Epic Story: 

Our social media application allows users to create accounts in order to create posts and share them with other people. Posts can have several pictures and anyone can express their thoughts by writing comments or giving likes. We also plan on adding debate and video calling features depending on how time allows us.

## User Stories:

### Must-Have

1. As a user, I want to be able to post pictures on my profile.
2. As a user, I want to be able to visit other people's profiles.
3. As a user, I must have a login form in order to enter my account.
4. As a user, I must have a signup form in order to create an account.
5. As a user, I want to be able to like posts and comments.
6. As a user, I want to be able to leave comments on posts.
7. As a user, I want to be able to follow other people and get followed by other people.
8. As a user, I want to see posts from people I follow in my main feed.
9. As a user, I want to have a profile picture, besides my posts.
10. As a user, I want to be able to expand replies to existing comments and reply to them.

### Nice-to-have

10. As a business-owner, I want to be able to see how many people viewed my profile over time.
11. As a user, I want to be able to make serverless video calls.
12. As a user, I want to get content recommendations based on posts I liked previously.
13. As a user, I want to get notifications.
